# NoArt

NoArt is a game about the challenging life of an artless game. The player, that is, **you** must explore and discover blank worlds in order to defeat the Triangle King, and recover the long lost Art.

Here's an alpha pre-dev v0.0.1 technical preview:

##### Devlog


* Nov 29 2015 - MonoGame version development has begun; However, Unity 5 has promising features we might take a lot of advantages in using.
So, what do we do now? Do we stay in MonoGame or do we migrate back to Unity, except this time v5 instead of v4? :sob:


* Nov 27 2015 - We are currently working on a MonoGame version of it! Will be on GitHub soon!
We intend to work with tiles and Unity doesn't fully meet the requirements. We'd have to install and learn third-party plugins, and that's just not the ideal situation.


* Nov 15 2015 - Started the project on Unity 4.
